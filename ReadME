*Its really fun to learn ethical hacking, it gives a nice grip on the linux environment and also gives a competitive spirit and team-playing skills. Everything is available on the internet, you don't need to fall into the dark side to learn hacking.

*I'll be continously updating stuffs as I'll get time and try to solve more rooms.
*Be safe, be responsible

*Some resources I follow:
1. YT channels- John hammond, LiveOverflow
