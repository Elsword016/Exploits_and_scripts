Metasploit- Every hacker's best friend, the framework provides many services to build payloads for attacks, gives access to victim's PC via a powerful meterpreter shell

Msfvenom - In one word, Metasploit unleashed!, as the name says, it helps in building up payloads to infect the target by building reverse TCP shell, can be used in any devices. https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfvenom/

Pwntools- a github repo containing many CTF tools in one package at times very reliable. (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)

aircrack-ng Suite – an open source WEP/WPA/WPA2 cracking tool which is usually bundled in most pentesting distributions

Pixiewps – a tool used to bruteforce offline the WPS pin exploiting the low or non-existing entropy of some APs (pixie dust attack)

*Note: For doing Wifi related hacking you'll need a external WiFI card, as onboard wifis(in laptops) doesn't support monitor mode. I used this -> https://www.amazon.in/INTEHA-Terabyte-Wireless-Receiver-External/dp/B07V2S5SWJ/ref=pd_vtp_3?pd_rd_w=jG4od&pf_rd_p=5888b0a4-c0d6-494e-b76a-e2b342b0dffb&pf_rd_r=9PHF951GE7ZSF70QEWH6&pd_rd_r=d88aa49e-d85c-419a-9b12-e8e65e184b72&pd_rd_wg=s9U8k&pd_rd_i=B07V2S5SWJ&psc=1
**Note: If you use A VM for hacking, then make sure the VM's ports are forwarded else the msfvenom and other payloads won't be able to initiate a meterpreter session.
